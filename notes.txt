This week I learned more about creating gits locally, as well as finally reaching the point of pushiing to github, which is something I've been wondering about for years ever since I started my first c# classes. We reinforced the concept of making commits in a local folder, how to undo changes pre-commit and how to list and view past commits. Then we created a public github project that now contains our permanently pushed commits of this sessions' homework files.
